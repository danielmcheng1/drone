## Project Brainstorming

## Initial Timeline / Sprint Plan
initial take photo and save to site

## Existing App Evaluation / Magic Quadrant
__Objective__: Find existing software / apps with the following capabilities:
1. Automate flying missions
2. Cache photos
3. Enable triggering for FLY NOW feature


[//]: # (check spelling, cost, system availability)
### Dimensions:
* Logistics: Cost, system availability (= color)
* Target Audience (Enterprise vs Hobbyist)
* Similar to surveying/photogrammetry vs flying custom missions and active tracking for own

### Native DJI Go4 App

### Hobbyist Apps for Recreation
These apps target single user consumer flying drones primarily for personal recreation. 

Their interface is very similar to the native DJI Go4 App (in essence they've provided an extra UI layer for further customization off of the DJI SDK). 
purely for recreation.

In increasing order of both cost and customizability:
1. Airnest 
2. DJI Ultimate Flight
3. Litchi
4. Autopilot

__Airnest__
Airnest markets themselves as "simply and easy to use" with a "Photostop style" interface. 
__Autopilot__

### Enterprise Apps for Surveyance
These apps diverge from the native DJI UI--while they do provide flight automation, the app itself is a tool, a means towards an end. 
That end is photogrammetry--generating a high-resolution or even 3D model via scores and hundreds of drone pictures. Hence enterprise is their target.
